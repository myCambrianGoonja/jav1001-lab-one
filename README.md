    LAB1 Variables And Logic

    main()  ->  Asks user to enter a number and then the original 
                unit and then the unit they want to convert
                the value to and convert the value for the user
    
    Following are the methods called in the main() to do the conversion:

                checkValidityInt()  ->  checks whether the value entred
                                        is a number or not if not then 
                                        it stops the execution
    
                checkValidString()  ->  checks whether the value entred
                                        is a valid string and that the 
                                        original unit and the conversion
                                        unit is not the same. If any of 
                                        the two is true then it stops 
                                        the execution of the method
    
        convertingToTheConvertUnit() -> checks for the original value 
                                        and the conversion unit value 
                                        and converts accordingly.  
 There are two branches the second branch uses Maps to map the values according to the formula needed also to customise the code
